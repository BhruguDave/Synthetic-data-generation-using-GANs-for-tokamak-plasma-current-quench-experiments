# Tokamak Plasma Current Quench Synthetic Data


## Contents of the Repository

- This repository contains the synthetic data generated by TabularGAN.
- [SyntheticData](./SyntheticData.zip) contains 1750 synthetic data generated using 35 different experimental data.
- Each data contains two columns. (1) Normalized Time (2) Normalized Current
- These synthetic patterns can be used as a training set for ML models to predict the disruptions in the tokamak beforehand.
- The generated dataset is the output of the research titled _Synthetic data generation using Generative Adversarial Network for tokamak plasma current quench experiments_
